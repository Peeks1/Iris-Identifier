# Iris-Identifier

My first machine learning project! Just a simple program that:
1) gets data from the famous iris flower classifier data repository
2) trains off 80% and then predicts the other 20% (uses SVC model)
3) prints how accurate it was

It was fun to get my feet wet with the "Hello world!" of machine learning!
